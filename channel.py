# order of execution starting scripts: (1) channel, (2) server, then (3) client
# so in 3 terminals, do the following in order:
# terminal 1: python channel.py
# terminal 2: python server.py
# terminal 3: python client.py

# this is a bidirectional channel sitting between client and server
# client talks to channel, then channel to server
# phrased another way, the channel is the "server" for the client
# server talks to channel, then channel to client
# phrased another way, the server is the "server" for the channel

# channel binds to UDP_PORT_CHANNEL to listen to client
# server binds to UDP_PORT_SERVER to listen to channel
# responses go back to auto-generated ports at client and channel

# in your client, you need to use UDP_PORT_CHANNEL
# e.g., set UDP_PORT = 5007

# in your server, you need to use UDP_PORT_SERVER
# e.g., set UDP_PORT = 5008

# assumptions / guarantees:
# the implementation is not fully concurrency safe and depends upon 
# eventual resends, otherwise it may fail or hang

# the channel should not drop the initial 3-way handshake or 4-way teardown messages
# the channel assumes the header has a fin field with the fin bit, checking naming in utils.py
# the channel may delay and drop any other messages (client->server msgs and server->client acks)

# the channel does NOT buffer messages in the current form, so it 
# likely will only work with stop-and-wait for client/server
# because it does not buffer messages, this also means the channel will NOT
# reorder messages

# however, because a dropped ack can result in the client resending a message, 
# it can result in duplicated messages at the server due to these resends (so 
# same payload can be received by server twice), so the 
# server should handle duplications, which can be done based on 
# the sequence numbers and keeping track at the server what data 
# has been received so far

# TODO: buffering could be added, probably using queue.LifoQueue for no reordering,
# and maybe queue.PriorityQueue with reordering, where the priority of incoming 
# messages is used to represent any (say random) reordering
